1. Analyze which payment providers are frequently used for these transactions (e.g., MTN). 
2. Are there multiple providers
3. Do some have a larger share of transactions?


Put all these in one code



Geographical Analysis:
1. Explore the distribution of transactions across different meter districts and regions. Perform data analysis
2.Plot a graph displaying the distribution of transactions across different meter districts and regions.


2.Are there areas with significantly more transactions than others?  Perform data analysis
Plot this in a graph with different colors.



Meter Category Breakdown:
1.Break down transactions by meter type (e.g., "PREPAID"). 
2.Perform an exploratory data analysis:
	- Which meter type has generated highest amount
	- Which meter type is used most in a Region
	- What is the most used payment channel to make the payment of meter type
	- Display all these values in a table
3.Plot a histogram plot histogram for each of the scenarios
4.Save the generated plot in the current working directory.

Are there other meter categories, and what is the distribution of transactions among them?
